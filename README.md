# GHdreamArt
Personal art project.

Based on the original <a href="https://github.com/google/deepdream">google/deep-dream</a> and <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/deep_dream.py">keras deep dream example</a>

original files have been modified to achieve my results.

To run these files, it assumes you have cloned this project in your "git folder", and that caffe and keras are in the same folder, installed correctly and with weights specified in the files downloaded appropriately according to the source projects.
